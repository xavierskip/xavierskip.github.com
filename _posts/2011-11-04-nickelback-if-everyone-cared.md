永远不要怀疑一小群信心坚定的人改变世界的能力
事实上，世界正是被这些人所改变～～


这得有什么样的情怀才写得出来这样的歌！




From underneath the trees, we watch the sky 
Confusing stars for satellites 
I never dreamed that you'd be mine 
But here we are, we're here tonight 
Singing amen, I'm alive 
Singing amen, I'm alive 


If everyone cared and nobody cried 
If everyone loved and nobody lied 
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride 
We'd see the day when nobody died 
And I'm singing 
Amen I..., I'm alive 
Amen I..., I'm alive 

And in the air the fireflies 
Our only light in paradise 
We'll show the world they were wrong 
And teach them all to sing along 
Singing amen I'm alive 
Singing amen I'm alive 

If everyone cared and nobody cried 
If everyone loved and nobody lied 
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride 
We'd see the day when nobody died 

And as we lie beneath the stars 
We realize how small we are 
If they could love like you and me 
Imagine what the world could be 
If everyone cared and nobody cried 
If everyone loved and nobody lied 
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride 
We'd see the day when nobody died 
We'd see the day, we'd see the day 
When nobody died 
We'd see the day, we'd see the day 
When nobody died 
We'd see the day when nobody died

如果每个人都学会关心 

如果每个人都学会关心 

树下我们仰望天空 
将自己融入点点繁星 
我从未想过，你是我的梦 
今夜我们共同祷告 
生命是如此美好 
生命是如此美好 

执著成就呐喊 
热爱得到真诚 
让我们共同分享荣耀 
希望是我们的前程 
让我们共同高歌 
生命是如此美好 
生命是如此美好 

夜空中的萤火虫 
是通往天堂的指路明灯 
让世人抛却烦恼 
随我们一起歌唱 
生命是如此美好 
生命是如此美好 

我们躺在星空下 
感觉到生命的渺小 
你我之爱 
会把世界从沉睡中唤醒
